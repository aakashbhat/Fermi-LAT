Replies to the notes in the latex file:

Note 1: we've checked the usage of present and past tenses and made corrections in places that we could identify.

Note 2: OK, we have checked that the numbers below 11 are replaced by words.

Note 3: OK

Note 4: this should be 4FGL. Now we use 4FGL to describe common features of the original 4FGL catalog and an updated version 4FGL-DR2 (see also response to Note 7 and footnote on page 2). We have kept only 4FGL in this place.

Note 5: we have replaced PSR in the text with pulsar and use PSR only as a label in tables, plots, and in the catalogs. We comment on the usage in footnote 2 on page 5.

Note 6: OK.

Note 7: PSR is used as a label for pulsars in the Fermi-LAT catalogs. We adopt this notation as well as a label in the catalog and also for shortness of notation in tables and plots. In the text we now use the full word pulsar. We have added footnote 2 on page 5 where PSR is mentioned for the first time with the explanation.

Note 8: OK.

Note 9: OK.

Note 10: OK, also changed TEchnique to Technique, this is a more common way of writing: Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique.

Note 11: OK.

Note 12: OK.

Note 13: changed to average significance

Note 14: Figure title added.

Note 15: OK.

Note 16: Changed the sentence:
"Also, all unassociated 3FGL pulsar candidates, which satisfy the $\sum_a p_a > 7$ condition, are associated with pulsars in the 4FGL-DR2."
to:
"In particular all unassociated 3FGL pulsar candidates, which satisfy the $\sum_a p_a > 7$ condition, are associated with pulsars in the 4FGL-DR2."
as it is supposed to strengthen the statement in the previous sentence.

Note 17, we defined now PWN and SNR.

Note 18: OK.

Note 19: OK.
