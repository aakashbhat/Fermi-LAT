\section{Prediction for unassociated sources in 3FGL and comparison with 4FGL}
\lb{sec:prediction}

Apply the algorithms on unassociated sources in 3FGL.

{\it Plot: add unassociated sources on the plots with domains for the best algorithm.}

Create a table with sources which are more likely to be pulsars (select about 20 the most likely candidates).
Compare the accuracy of the algorithm for the sources which have an associate now in the 4FGL catalog.
