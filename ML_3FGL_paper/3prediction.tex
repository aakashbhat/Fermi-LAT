\section{Prediction for unassociated sources in 3FGL and comparison with 4FGL}
\lb{sec:3FGLprediction}



{\it Plot: add unassociated sources on the plots with domains for the best algorithm.}

Comment: Create a table with sources which are more likely to be pulsars (select about 20 the most likely candidates).
Compare the accuracy of the algorithm for the sources which have an associate now in the 4FGL catalog.\\

In this section we use the best algorithms from the previous section to predict classes for the unassociated sources in the 3FGL. We then use the associations which exist for some of these sources in the 4FGL to check the accuracy of our methods on the unassociated data. In this section we work only with Random Forests, Neural Networks, AdaBoost, and Logistic Regression. \\
