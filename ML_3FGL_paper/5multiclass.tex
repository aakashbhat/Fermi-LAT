\section{3-Class Classification}
In this section we discuss the multi-class method\footnotemark\footnotetext{Multi here refers to any non-binary number of classes}. Instead of only using sources which had AGN and PSR as their classification we added 108 sources in the 3FGL catalog which have a classification not falling under AGN or PSR. We gave them a classification of 'OTHER'. We ran our codes again, first to find the optimum parameters as was done in section 2. Figure \ref{fig:tree_multi} and \ref{fig:nets_multi} shows our results. Every method except the Neural Networks show the same behaviour as before and therefore we keep the same parameters for our final models. For Neural Networks the behaviour is also the same but the optimal parameter is found to be 600 epochs instead of 300. We keep the same number of neurons as before.

The final accuracies of our chosen model for 1000 runs are given below in table \ref{tab:selected_algs_multi}.
