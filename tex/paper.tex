\begin{abstract}
We present the classification of AGNs and Pulsars using different machine learning algorithms in the Fermi-LAT 4 and 8 year catalogs. First we compare the traditional machine learning methods including boosted decision trees, Random forests, and Logistic regression. Then we move on to a nueral network based classification of known sources. Finally, we make predictions using the 8-year catalog for future studies.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Fermi-LAT}
Please note that the first paragraph of a section or subsection is
not indented. The first paragraph that follows a table, figure,
equation etc. does not need an indent, either.

Subsequent paragraphs, however, are indented.

\subsubsection{Sample Heading (Third Level)} Only two levels of
headings should be numbered. Lower level headings remain unnumbered;
they are formatted as run-in headings.

\paragraph{Sample Heading (Fourth Level)}
The contribution should contain no more than four levels of
headings. Table~\ref{tab1} gives a summary of all heading levels.

\begin{table}
\caption{Table captions should be placed above the
tables.}\label{tab1}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Heading level &  Example & Font size and style\\
\hline
Title (centered) &  {\Large\bfseries Lecture Notes} & 14 point, bold\\
1st-level heading &  {\large\bfseries 1 Introduction} & 12 point, bold\\
2nd-level heading & {\bfseries 2.1 Printing Area} & 10 point, bold\\
3rd-level heading & {\bfseries Run-in Heading in Bold.} Text follows & 10 point, bold\\
4th-level heading & {\itshape Lowest Level Heading.} Text follows & 10 point, italic\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\section{Work}
\subsection{Machine Learning}

We began our work by sorting the data into known and unknown sources. Since our work is supervised learning we only choose known sources for training. The known sources were a total of 1933, with 1739 AGNs and 166 pulasars, after cleaning up of the data. Then our work was sorted into two parts. The first was to train using tree based machine learning techniques and the second was to train using nueral networks. 

\section{Tree-based methods}

We used the following tree based methods and developed simple scripts in python: Random Forests, Extra trees classifier, AdaBoost, Gradient boosting. The modules for tree-based methods were imported from sk-learn which is available in python. The primary parameters were the number of trees and the maximum depth of nodes. \\

\caption{OOB score for random forest based learning vs. number of trees}
\end{figure}
As can be seen above the score tends to saturate around 1000 and 5000 trees respectively. A similar approach shows the following with regards to the maximum depth of trees for 50 trees.\\

Please try to avoid rasterized images for line-art diagrams and
schemas. Whenever possible, use vector graphics instead (see
Fig.~\ref{fig1}).

\begin{theorem}
This is a sample theorem. The run-in heading is set in bold, while
the following text appears in italics. Definitions, lemmas,
propositions, and corollaries are styled the same way.
\end{theorem}
%
% the environments 'definition', 'lemma', 'proposition', 'corollary',
% 'remark', and 'example' are defined in the LLNCS documentclass as well.

\begin{proof}
Proofs, examples, and remarks have the initial word in italics,
while the following text appears in normal font.
\end{proof}
For citations of references, we prefer the use of square brackets
and consecutive numbers. Citations using labels or the author/year
convention are also acceptable. The following bibliography provides
a sample reference list with entries for journal
articles~\cite{ref_article1}, an LNCS chapter~\cite{ref_lncs1}, a
book~\cite{ref_book1}, proceedings without editors~\cite{ref_proc1},
and a homepage~\cite{ref_url1}. Multiple citations are grouped
\cite{ref_article1,ref_lncs1,ref_book1},
\cite{ref_article1,ref_book1,ref_proc1,ref_url1}.
